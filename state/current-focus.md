C4-III — DONE — EXACT-HEAD AND EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFIED

D4-B — Safe migration execution and durable UpdateLog — DONE — MERGED AND EXACT-HEAD VERIFIED
D4-C — User-facing update status and packaged failure UX — DONE — MERGED AND EXACT-HEAD/EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFIED
D4-D — Exact-package update verification and D4 lifecycle closure — DONE — FINAL EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFICATION PASSED
D5 — Remote install checklist — NOT AUTHORIZED BY CR-013
Product release readiness — NOT CLAIMED
```

## Current task

**No further implementation slice is authorized by CR-013.**

D4 is complete and lifecycle-closed. Starting D5 requires a separate authorization decision/change request. Until then, do not implement remote-install work, auto-update/download, signing/notarization/DMG/App Store/release channels, product release readiness claims or Restore changes.

## Final D4 evidence

- exact tested main/head: `ec88b09193c8ed041e17daef3e3ffc0193d1b559`;
- D4-D run: `31751386881`; artifact `9201217317`; digest `sha256:0dc707f8823eb69934a5bc3b3b6824557533bafa3e1e86a7f13fc29c19a1af7d`;
- final result: `PASS — FULL AUTOMATED SMOKE PASSED`.
